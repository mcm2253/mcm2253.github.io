4 to do list:

	1. on 4-1.html, 4-dead.html, add back button in column of 6 and add add a done link that goes to the walking dead website in the next 6 columns
	2. Make all the links buttons
	3. add images into 4-dead.html, size them properly
	4. run w3 validation on them and make sure they don't have any errors
	5. Add btn btn-default classes on your links
	6. make sure all your css is in the css file
	7. put in a background image
8. use wells where appropriate
9. use the box model: put padding and margin around things to make them look better
10. put in tooltips


Notes:
	- ids on one element ever (like you have your id)
	- classes on many elements (in a class there's a lot of people)

	- ids are more important and specific than classes

	- inline css > header css > external stylesheet

	- !important
		- why it's bad 
		- don't use it
		- when you see it - remove them all and properly implement css specificity
